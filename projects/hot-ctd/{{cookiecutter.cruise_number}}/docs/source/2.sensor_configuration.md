# Summary

Temperature Sensors: Primary (SN {{cookiecutter._primary_temp_sn}} 


{numref}`figure1.1` shows all the stations and casts completed during the
HOT-336. One CTD cast was conducted at Kahe Point (Station-1, Cast 1) to 
1020 dbar. 15 CTD casts 
were conducted at Station ALOHA (Station-2).Cast-2 and
Cast-15 at Station ALOHA were near-bottom
deep casts conducted to 4801 and
4801 dbar, respectively, with the CTD
altimeter reading 12 m and
12 m off the bottom. All other
casts were to 1020 dbar. One yoyo CTD cast was done at the WHOTS-17 
mooring (Station 50), which consisted of
4 cycles down to 200 dbar
. No CTD cast was conducted at Ka'ena Point (Station-6).

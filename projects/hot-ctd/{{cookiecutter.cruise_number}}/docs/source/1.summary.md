# Summary

Post-cruise processing of CTD data from {{ cookiecutter.cruise_date_start }} to
{{ cookiecutter.cruise_date_end }}, HOT-{{cookiecutter.cruise_number}} cruise
of the Hawaii Ocean Time-series.

The HOT-{{cookiecutter.cruise_number}} was conducted aboard the
{{cookiecutter.research_vessel}} from {{cookiecutter.cruise_date_start }} to
{{cookiecutter.cruise_date_end}}. {{cookiecutter.total_number_of_ctd_casts}}
casts were deployed from starboard using the Rochester 0.322" EM wire with the
Hawboldt Launch and Recovery System (LARS) and heave compensation.

HOT-{{cookiecutter.cruise_number}}

{%- if cookiecutter.total_number_of_ctd_casts_at_KAHE == "1" -%} . One CTD cast

Cast-{{cookiecutter.first_deep_cast_number}} and
Cast-{{cookiecutter.second_deep_cast_number}} at Station ALOHA were near-bottom
deep casts conducted to {{cookiecutter.first_deep_cast_max_depth}} and
{{cookiecutter.second_deep_cast_max_depth}} dbar, respectively, with the CTD
altimeter reading {{cookiecutter.first_deep_cast_altimeter_reading}} m and
{{cookiecutter.second_deep_cast_altimeter_reading}} m off the bottom. All other
casts were to 1020 dbar

off the bottom.All other cast were to 1020 dbar. {% endif %}

{%- if cookiecutter.yoyo_cast_performed_at_WHOTS == "yes" -%} . One yoyo CTD
cast was done at the WHOTS-{{cookiecutter.current_whots_number}} mooring (
{{cookiecutter.current_whots_station}}), which consisted of
{{cookiecutter.total_number_of_yoyo_cycles_at_WHOTS}} cycles down to 200 dbar
{% endif %}

{%- if cookiecutter.total_number_of_ctd_casts_at_KAENA == "1" -%}.  
One CTD cast was conducted at Ka'ena Point (Station-6) to
{{cookiecutter.deep_cast_max_depth_at_KAENA}} dbar. The CTD altimeter showed
that the rosette was {{cookiecutter.deep_cast_altimeter_reading_at_KAENA}}m
from the bottom

{%- elif cookiecutter.total_number_of_ctd_casts_at_KAENA == "0" -%}. No CTD
cast was conducted at Ka'ena Point (Station-6). {% endif %}

Winds measured at the WHOTS-{{cookiecutter.current_whots_number}} buoy near
Station ALOHA were about {{cookiecutter.wind_speed_measured_at_WHOTS}} knots
from the {{cookiecutter.wind_direction_measured_at_WHOTS}}.

The mixed layer was approximately {{cookiecutter.mixed_layer_at_ALOHA}} dbar 
for all the casts at Station ALOHA. The oxygen maximum was observed at about 
{{cookiecutter.oxygen_maximum_depth_at_ALOHA}} dbar 
[~ {math}`{{cookiecutter.oxygen_maximum_value_at_ALOHA}} {\mu molkg^{-1}}`],
while the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) was observed at about 
{{cookiecutter.oxygen_minimum_zone_depth_at_ALOHA}} dbar 
[~{math}`{{cookiecutter.oxygen_minimum_zone_value_at_ALOHA}} {\mu molkg^{-1}}`]
. The salinity minimum was seen at about 
{{cookiecutter.salinity_minimum_depth_at_ALOHA}} dbar
[~{{cookiecutter.salinity_minimum_value_at_ALOHA}}]. 

Observations of the deepwater below 4700 dbar showed that bottom potential
temperatures were `warmer or colder `than the previous ten HOT cruises
({numref}`figure9.1`). Both deep casts featured a constant gradient until 
reaching out to about 4700dbar. After this depth, the first deep cast 
dropped from about 1.112 째C and maintained a constant potential temperature 
of 1.1095 째C until the near-bottom. The second-deep cast dropped from 1.
1135째C to about 1.1125째C. Both primary and secondary oxygen sensors SN 3761 
and SN 43918 displayed a slight oxygen increase at 4700dbar.
